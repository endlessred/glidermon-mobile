# Outfit Customization System

A comprehensive user-driven cosmetic customization system allowing players to create, save, and share unique character looks with precise positioning controls.

## Overview

The Outfit System transforms the simple cosmetic equipping into a creative platform where users can fine-tune positioning, rotation, and layering of cosmetic items to create unique character expressions and share them with the community.

## Core Architecture

### Data Models

```typescript
type UserCosmeticCustomization = {
  cosmeticId: string;
  adjustments: {
    offset: { x: number; y: number };     // Position tweaks (-20 to +20 pixels)
    rotation: number;                     // Angle adjustments (-45° to +45°)
    scale: number;                        // Size tweaks (0.8x to 1.2x)
    layer: number;                        // Custom z-depth ordering
  };
  name: string;                           // User's custom name for this adjustment
  tags: string[];                         // "retro", "formal", "silly"
};

type OutfitSlot = {
  id: string;                            // Unique outfit identifier
  name: string;                          // User-defined outfit name
  cosmetics: {
    [socketType]: {
      itemId: string;
      customization: UserCosmeticCustomization;
    }
  };
  isDefault: boolean;                    // Is this the default local outfit?
  isPublic: boolean;                     // Is this the public gallery outfit?
  createdAt: Date;
  lastModified: Date;
  thumbnail?: string;                    // Auto-generated preview image
};

type OutfitPreset = {
  id: string;
  name: string;                          // "Smooth Criminal", "Wizard Vibes"
  description: string;                   // Short description
  cosmetics: string[];                   // Which items are equipped
  customizations: UserCosmeticCustomization[];
  creator: string;                       // Who made it
  likes: number;                         // Community rating
  featured: boolean;                     // Staff picked
  tags: string[];                        // Categories for filtering
  createdAt: Date;
};
```

### Storage Strategy

```typescript
type OutfitStorage = {
  slots: OutfitSlot[];                   // User's saved outfits
  maxSlots: number;                      // Current slot limit
  activeLocalOutfit: string;             // Currently equipped for gameplay
  activePublicOutfit: string;            // Displayed in gallery/contests
  unlockedCustomizations: string[];     // Available advanced tools
};
```

## User Interface Design

### Main Outfit Screen

**Layout Structure:**
- **Header**: Outfit name, save/load controls, slot selector
- **Left Panel**: Live character preview with current outfit
- **Right Panel**: Cosmetic slot tabs and adjustment controls
- **Bottom Bar**: Quick actions (reset, randomize, share)

### Cosmetic Slot Management

**Slot Categories:**
1. **Head**: Hats, glasses, masks, hair accessories
2. **Body**: Shirts, armor, capes, wings, backpacks
3. **Accessories**: Held items, belts, jewelry
4. **Effects**: Auras, particles, environmental effects
5. **Poses**: Character stance and expression (Public Gallery Only)

**Per-Slot Controls:**
- **Item Selector**: Grid of owned cosmetics for this slot
- **Position Sliders**: X/Y offset with live preview
- **Rotation Wheel**: Circular control with degree markings
- **Scale Slider**: Size adjustment with preview
- **Layer Control**: Z-depth ordering within slot category

### Adjustment Boundaries

**Safety Limits:**
```typescript
const ADJUSTMENT_LIMITS = {
  offset: { x: [-20, 20], y: [-20, 20] },    // Pixel range
  rotation: [-45, 45],                        // Degrees
  scale: [0.8, 1.2],                         // Multiplier
  layer: [-5, 5]                             // Relative z-depth
};
```

**Validation Rules:**
- Prevent cosmetics from moving completely off-screen
- Warn when items overlap awkwardly
- Test positioning against walk/blink animation cycles
- Enforce performance limits (max complexity per outfit)
