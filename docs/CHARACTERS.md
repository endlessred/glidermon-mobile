🌳 NPC Backstories
🐿️ Sable the Goth Squirrel (Hats & Small Cosmetics Vendor)

Backstory: Sable used to be part of a “cheerful squirrel troupe” that performed acorn juggling shows on the lower branches. One day, she realized everyone was laughing at her, not with her. She declared acorns “dead to him” and moved to the shaded side of the shop. Secretly, she still practices juggling late at night.

Quirk Reveal: If you catch her humming upbeat songs, she’ll deny it furiously.

Sidequest Hook: Recover Sable’s “lost juggling acorns,” which she pretends she doesn’t want back.

🐸 Luma the Tree Frog (Player Skins & Premium Cosmetics Vendor)

Backstory: Luma comes from a family of “royal frogs” who once ran a swamp palace fashion salon. She left because she thought swamp styles were “so last season” and moved to the big tree for more “sunlight, sparkle, and opportunity.” She writes long, gushy letters back to her family but never sends them.

Quirk Reveal: She has a secret stash of swampy old clothes she calls her “ugly duckling chic.”

Sidequest Hook: Help Luma design a new “runway line” that combines swamp fashion with tree fashion.

🦉 Orvus the Builder Owl (Nest Upgrades)

Backstory: Orvus once studied “branch engineering” at the Great Canopy Academy. He flunked out after accidentally building a bridge that led straight into a hornet’s nest. Since then, he’s obsessed with “the perfect blueprint” and insists every project will redeem his reputation. He probably misplaces more tools than he uses.

Quirk Reveal: He keeps a diary of “genius ideas” that are actually terrible (e.g., square wheels, floating ladders).

Sidequest Hook: Test out one of Orvus’s ridiculous inventions to prove it works (or hilariously fails).

🦜 Juno the Arcade Parrot (Mini Games)

Backstory: Juno used to work as a pirate’s lookout parrot but got bored of squawking “land ho!” and “fire the cannons!” all the time. After sneaking away with a chest of arcade tokens, he reinvented himself as a hype-bird entertainer. He loves competition, but is terrified of silence — he’ll start narrating anything if it gets too quiet.

Quirk Reveal: He still accidentally blurts out old pirate lingo mid-hype.

Sidequest Hook: Collect “legendary tokens” Juno swears are from his pirate days, but might just be bottlecaps.

😴 Moss the Sloth (Automation NPC)

Backstory: Moss claims to have been a “branch champion gamer” in his youth, beating everyone at contests. No one believes him because he barely moves. In truth, he really was good, but he burned out from always trying too hard, so he decided to nap forever instead. His hammock is woven from old game banners.

Quirk Reveal: Occasionally, he’ll slip and start spouting elite gaming jargon before realizing he gave away his secret.

Sidequest Hook: Prove his old skills by challenging him in a high-score rematch.

🐝 Zippa the Traveling Bee (Seasonal/Event Vendor)

Backstory: Zippa was once part of a hive that specialized in producing “performance nectar” for racing beetles. She left because she wanted more adventure and color in her life, and now collects exotic pollen blends from around the world. She’s basically a pollen hipster.

Quirk Reveal: She gets distracted mid-sentence if she smells a new flower.

Sidequest Hook: Help her find rare flowers for her pollen collection, in exchange for seasonal cosmetics.

🦜 Carmine the Cardinal (Gallery/Fashion NPC)

Backstory: Carmine claims to have strutted down the “Grand Canopy Runway” — a legendary fashion show at the top of the world-tree. Whether that’s true or just self-mythologizing is unclear. He fled the big leagues to curate “authentic style” among real forest dwellers. Deep down, he worries he peaked too early.

Quirk Reveal: When no one is around, he wears extremely plain brown feathers to “blend in.”

Sidequest Hook: Help Carmine put together a “comeback runway” by gathering outfits from across the tree.
