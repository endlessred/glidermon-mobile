Progression Economy

Currencies

Points (soft): Earned from TIR, trend stability, and quests. Spent on upgrades, cosmetics.

Gems (premium): Purchasable or rewarded; used for cosmetics bundles and accelerants (no pay-to-win health mechanics).

Tickets (event): Temporary currency for limited-time shops.

Primary earn (per minute tick)

Base/minute = f(TIR state, trend):

In-range & flat/slight = 1.0× baseline.

In-range & gentle up/down = 0.7×.

Out-of-range = 0.2× floor (never zero to avoid punishment).

Daily bounties: e.g., 3× 20‑min stable windows, 1× recovery-from-high, 1× recovery-from-low (safety-first messaging).

Sinks & pacing

NPC upgrades: linear→sublinear costs; add production multipliers and automation (e.g., passive chest spawns).

Nest upgrades: unlock slots (props, decorations, pets), background scenes.

Cosmetics: hats/props/skins/backgrounds; recolors and seasonal variants.

Prestige (Molting): soft reset NPC levels → permanent multiplier + rare skin.

Caps & anti-burnout

Daily soft cap with overflow into rested bonus; weekly pity timers for rare drops.


Analytics & XP Math (Initial)

Track: session count, TIR minutes, trend distribution, quest completion, chest opens, cosmetic acquisition.

Health KPI (player): daily TIR delta, recovery count/time.

Economy KPI: points earned/spent, upgrade velocity, cosmetic attach rate, sub conversion.

A/B: chest cadence (30/45 min), daily cap sizes, starter cosmetic appeal.

Baseline XP/Points (tunable)

Stable minute: 10 pts; gentle trend: 7 pts; out-of-range: 2 pts.

Daily bounties: 250–500 pts each.

NPC L1→L2 cost: 500 pts; grows ~1.35× per level.

🎯 Two Tracks for Points

When the player earns points (from staying in range, completing bounties, etc.):

XP Track (total points)

Every point earned contributes to an XP pool.

XP is what levels up the player account (and potentially NPCs when upgraded).

XP is cumulative — never spent.

Currency Track (spendable points)

At the same time, those points also enter the spendable currency balance.

Currency is what players use in the shop for cosmetics, upgrades, etc.

Currency is consumed when spent.


Leveling System (Baseline Math)

We want progression to feel smooth early, then stretch out to allow months/years of play. The classic shape is exponential or quadratic growth of XP requirements.

Formula (candidate)
XP required for Level N = Base * (N ^ Growth)

Levels 1–5: Easy to hit in the first week, keeps players motivated.

Levels 6–15: Slower stretch (~2–3 weeks each), aligns with NPC upgrades and shop unlocks.

Beyond 20: Long-haul grind, meant for prestige/molting resets.

🪙 Example Player Flow

Day 1: Earn ~2,000 points (≈200 minutes in-range + bounties).

XP track → Level 5 by end of Day 1.

Currency track → 2,000 points spendable in shop.

Day 7: Earn ~12,000 total points.

XP track → Level 10.

Currency track → 12,000 cumulative currency earned, though maybe 6–8k spent on cosmetics.

🎨 Why Two Tracks?

XP (progression): Provides long-term sense of growth — can’t be undone by spending.

Currency (spend): Gives immediate choice and agency — cosmetics, NPC upgrades, etc.

Splitting them prevents the “I spent all my points so now I can’t level up” frustration that some incremental games fall into.

⚖️ Next Step: We’ll want to tune Base and Growth around average daily earn. If we expect ~2,000 points/day steady play, then hitting Level 10 in the first week feels good, with diminishing returns after.

How leveling works (clear rules)

Every time you earn points, you get:

XP (cumulative, never spent) → gates player level.

Currency (spendable) → shop/NPC upgrades/cosmetics.

Level-up trigger: when your lifetime XP ≥ the required XP for the next level.

XP requirement curve (baseline):
XP to go from level N → N+1 = Base * N^Growth
With Base = 100, Growth = 1.5 (tunable).

XP thresholds (cumulative to reach level L)

L2: 100

L3: 383

L4: 902

L5: 1,702

L6: 2,820

L7: 4,290

L8: 6,142

L9: 8,405

L10: 11,105

L15: 31,998

L20: 67,135

L25: 118,810

L30: 189,030

Pace at different daily earn rates

(How many days it takes to hit the level, assuming XP/day equals your points/day.)

Level	1k/day	2k/day	3k/day
2	0.10 d	0.05 d	0.03 d
5	1.70 d	0.85 d	0.57 d
10	11.11 d	5.55 d	3.70 d
15	32.00 d	16.00 d	10.67 d
20	67.14 d	33.57 d	22.38 d
25	118.81 d	59.41 d	39.60 d
30	189.03 d	94.52 d	63.01 d

Quick read:

Week 1: casual (1–2k/day) lands around L5–10.

Month 1: steady 2k/day reaches L15–16.

Long tail: levels stretch nicely toward prestige/molting territory.

Sanity with your minute-tick earnings

If you keep the earlier baseline (e.g., 10 pts/min when in-range & stable):

2 hours stable ≈ 1,200 pts (and 1,200 XP).

A day with ~3 hours good stability + bounties easily hits ~2k.

Tuning knobs (simple, powerful)

Base (100): makes early levels faster/slower.

Growth (1.5): controls late-game stretch.

1.4 → faster; 1.6 → slower.

You can also add level-up rewards (cosmetics shards, chest) to make milestones feel chunky without changing the curve.
